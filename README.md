# 🚦 Automated Toll Tax Estimation System

The **Automated Toll Tax Estimation System** is a real-time **AI-powered traffic monitoring solution** that detects vehicles, tracks their movement, and automatically calculates toll tax revenue based on vehicle type.
The system leverages **deep learning and computer vision** techniques to ensure accurate vehicle counting and classification without manual intervention.

This project is designed for **smart transportation systems**, **intelligent toll booths**, and **traffic analytics applications**.
